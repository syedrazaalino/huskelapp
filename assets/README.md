# Assets Directory

This directory is for application icons and images.

## Optional Icons

You can add the following icons to customize the app appearance:

- `tray-icon.png` - System tray icon (16x16 or 32x32 pixels recommended)
- `icon.png` - Application window icon (256x256 pixels recommended)
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon file for the executable (for building)

If these icons are not provided, the app will use default Electron icons or programmatically generated icons.
